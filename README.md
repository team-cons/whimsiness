Funky bash scripts ayo

## ðŸ“‚ Nautilus scripts/ ##
Right-click actions. To install, put them in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts

I don't know for other file managers.


### ðŸ“„ pin ###
Transform any file or folder into a pseudo "app", so it appears in the app grid or launcher, and can be put into a dock (the latter of which I was striving for)
- Detects automagically the right icon to use
- includes actions: remove the "app", edit it, open the location of the file or folder
- Theoretically desktop agnostic

      <td><img src="https://github.com/teamcons/whimsiness/blob/main/img/pin3.png" /></td>
  </table>
</div>


### ðŸ“„ autoicon ###
Change folder icon to reflect its content.
For example, put folder-pictures icon if the detected content of the folder is mostly pictures.
This is done in a way that adapts to icon theme change.
